Walkthrough:
1. Player obtains a .wav file and has to fix the header to reveal a gif where each frame is a qrcode.
2. Each qr code decodes to a letter. On joining the letters a fake flag is obtained which is the password to the zip file appended to the end of the gif.
3. On extracting the contents of the zip file, the player obtains two files, viz. a png file and a hexdump. (Observe that the header of the flag.iso file is all zeroes and it is of the same size of buufer.png. A clear hint is to XOR both of them.)
4. Player needs to XOR both files to obtain an image of a barcode. (Use online calculator or python)
5. The barcode identifies to be a Micropdf417. Using an online barcode decoder, player can obtain a hash which is the required flag. (Link : https://products.aspose.app/barcode/recognize/pdf417)
